	\section{VHDL}
		Every VHDL structure must have an entity,
		which describes the appearance of the defice externally,
		and an architecture that defines the way it implements the entity.

		All connections are PORTs, which must be uniquely named in the entity definition.
		They can have a mode (IN, OUT, INOUT, BUFFER)
		a type (BIT, BIT\_VECTOR)
		and a set of levels (BIT\_VECTOR (0 TO 3)).

		Variables are known as  SIGNALs, which have the same properties as PORTs.

		The entity

	g : nor2 PORT MAP (c,d,f);
END archlogic;
